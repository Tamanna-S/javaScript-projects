Mouseover effects are a routine part of web development with JavaScript â€“ and they are a lot of fun!

A mouseover effect simply means adding interactivity to certain elements and sections of your web page. For instance, in this project you will create an area of happy bouncing balls that expand when you hover your mouse over them.

This is a JavaScript project you can build over an afternoon or during a weekend of JavaScript coding. And once you are done, I bet you have a few further ideas for building more mouseover effects with JS!
